Hi, Iâ€™m Javier FernÃ¡ndez FernÃ¡ndez. Iâ€™m currently a fourth year Data Science & Engineering student at UC3M. I recently completed a study abroad program at Purdue University for the 2024/2025 academic year. Iâ€™m excited to collaborate on real-world challenges involving data analysis, machine learning, and programming.
